I want to take a moment to speak to anyone struggling with anxiety and depression who is using medication to manage it. 

I RESPECT your courage wholeheartedly. 

I firmly believe that we need support to work with difficult mental states and seeing a great psychiatrist and therapist are part of the way we can care for ourselves on that journey. 

If you’ve struggled with mental health issues (which are, in my opinion, health issues), then you know how debilitating the situation can be. Taking medication is sometimes an important part of restoring your capacity to participate in life. 

What working with a healer can do is support that process by uncovering energetic feedback loops that keep triggering the patterns of anxiety and depression in the nervous system. Consider anxiety and depression like very strong physical memories that keep replaying when the condition that evokes them arises. 

Energy therapy can help to settle those body memories and allow for gut level emotions to be processed through the psycho-emotional system instead of physical channels. Once the body starts to understand its options there can be dramatic shifts in the severity of situations like panic attacks and the length of depressive episodes. 

Additionally yoga can be a helpful and supportive practice to connect the dots between your inner and outer states. 

All of this can be an adjunct to the work you’re already doing. Homeostasis can get re-calibrated and then you get to make the choice about how you want to shift to meet a more settled version of yourself. Sometimes that includes medicine, sometimes not, but that question becomes less relevant as you thrive.
