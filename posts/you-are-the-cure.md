As a healer it is my greatest wish that you who want to stay on planet Earth have the opportunity to do so. It would be an utter untruth to suggest that when you are suffering and enter my practice that I am not invested in whether or not you achieve the relief you long for. Like any empath, I care deeply and wish for you to have everything they want out of life. 

But the truth is that if any of us were able to magically erase another's suffering, we would do it in a millisecond without hesitation. The reality is that nobody controls another person's healing. We each of us have an unknown time frame, contribution, and trajectory on this planet. 

To think that I alone have the alchemy to change that is a kind of arrogance that causes its own karmic harm. It gives humans already fighting for their life or quality of life the sense that they have even less power over the situation than they already do. 

 I have experienced miracles, and I have also been promised miracles. that did not come true. I am very clear with everyone that graces my presence that my role is not curative. My purpose is to restore as much wholeness, health, dignity, connection, and self awareness as possible so that there is a return to the sense of self that is never compromised, always healed, eternally light and full of love. 

These are not small things. They pave the way toward healing, and they elevate quality of life so that no matter what suffering might befall us, there is a safe space to be whole, to be seen, and to be beheld. 

 In the end, it is you who are the cure. Your beauty. Your courage. Your tender human heart. You are all you ever need. And I am grateful to be in a position to help support that unfolding.
