You can definitely do more than you think you can but probably less than you think you should.

Yoga’s mission is to liberate and free the life force. Any other benefits are fringe benefits.

When you enter the domain of woodchucks and birch trees, you immediately know what is utterly noble about the practice and what is completely ridiculous.

Your body tells a story but not the same one you tell to it.

Consciousness is king, the body queen, and the heart their sacred palace.

There is always and forever the chance to release into growth.
