# About Jennifer

<div class="about-image-section">

<img src="/static/img/avatar-sokolov.jpg" alt="portrait of Jennifer">

Jennifer lives at the intersection between the spiritual and the sensate. She is committed to helping people feel their way into healing through her preternatural sensitivity to the human body mind and spirit. Jennifer has spent time in reverent study with the greats of movement and energy healing and has created her own method of deep listening, sensing, and shifting her client’s energetic blocks through love, visualization, compassion and presence. She is an accomplished yogini and is able to translate the complexities of the spiritual realm to practical, clear and actionable practices for modern living. She also likes writing and cats.
