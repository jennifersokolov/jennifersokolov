## ENERGY THERAPY

Prana, chi, jing… almost every essential culture has a name for the vital energy that is our lifeforce. Taking time to work through energetic blockages can create new levels of resilience, resistance to illness, relief from chronic pain, and can aid recovery from trauma. Modalities include Reiki, Integrative Manual Therapy (IMT), and Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy (BCST). 

**Choose these sessions if  you are looking for:**

- Relief from intractable conditions that haven’t responded to other modalities.
- Shifts in stuck life situations. Discovery of what might be a root cause for discomfort, illness, or pain 
- Softening of mental/emotional turmoil
- Quieting of nervous system disorders

## YOGA FOR THE HEART AND MIND

A personal practice changes everything. It is the foundation of stability. It is the ground of support for a complex and shifting world. It is succor for the aging process. It is a restorer of space for creativity. In short, it is the cup for the universe to fill. 

**Choose this work if you are looking for:**

- Yoga Mentorship. Relief from chronic pain, anxiety and depression, stuckness, somatic issues, or complex social or family dynamics. 
- Practices from the whole Yogic Tradition emphasizing meditation, breathing, philosophy, mantra/chanting, and asana influenced by the Desikachar and Iyengar traditions.
