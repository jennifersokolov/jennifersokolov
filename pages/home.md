  # We share 97% percent of our essence with stars. Let’s transform the clouds
  blocking your sparkle to let the real you shine through…

  <span class="h1 hero-text">The Process</span> No one comes to a healer without
  a reason. Our lives are complicated and messy and filled with impossible
  transitions. Though it might not feel this way now, you are not those things. 


  You are light and loving and filled with the capacity for joy. 


  Our work will help you travel from the density of pain, isolation, and
  relentlessness into the vastness of you that can’t be named. 


  Soon, you will feel the power of your energy bursting through the inner dams
  that are keeping you blocked, tired, and small. 


  ## The way energy therapy works


  - We will take time to let the story of what brings you here unfold at the
  pace that’s right for you. 


  - We will uncover the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of
  your narrative that might be contributing to your experience of feeling
  unwell. 


  - We will be present to the mystery of being alive--the timeless time shared
  between two people that allows the unknown to become known. 


  - We will create pathways to cultivate continued growth, acceptance,
  connection and love. 


  ## The Bigger How


  I sense the rhythms and vibrations of fluid and light. I feel deep brain
  space, the oscillation of organs, the way in which the cosmos folds and
  unfolds until a human life is born. I feel the perturbations of wellness and
  illness and all the tethers that exist between them. I sit with the mystery so
  that you can, too. 


  ## What to expect in our hour together


  In energy sessions, I like to start the work lying on the table and asking
  questions as our fields settle. What we talk about, if we talk, is entirely
  related to what is coming up for you in that moment. 


  In yoga sessions, we will spend considerable time looking at the rhythms of
  your life, what you need from yoga, and how to support the discipline of a
  daily home practice. 


  In combined sessions (2 hours), we take our time and do both.
