# FAQs

Welcome to the practice. Here are a few helpful pieces of information to make your pre- and post- session experience smooth. If you do not find answers to your questions, feel free to reach out to me at info@jennifersokolov.com.

**What do I need to prepare for a virtual session?**\
You will need a comfortable place to recline or lie down, and an internet connection. I will send a Zoom link shortly before the session begins and we will start the session with a check in. We will stay together as you rest and receive, communicating as much or as little as you need. 

**Should I come to a session sick?**\
In the new reality of virtual healing, you most definitely can be sick and receive work. I encourage you to do so to help speed the process of any illness, including COVID. 

**What payment methods do you accept?**\
I accept credit cards, Venmo, and Zelle. 

**How soon should I book another session?**\
The frequency is very individual. If we are working to shift a complex situation, then weekly is the best rhythm. If there is stagnation and stuckness, monthly tends to be very helpful. Check-ins can happen at any time and can align with your life and goals, seasonal changes, or known stressors like the holiday season. 

**What happens if I need other support?**\
I have strong connections with a number of other wonderful practitioners of a variety of modalities. We can figure out together what you might need to compliment the healing work.

**What should I wear?**\
Please wear comfortable clothes that you could easily move in. Energy Therapy occurs in a comfortable position and I want you to be able to rest. Be prepared to remove big jewelry, watches and belts. You will also take off your shoes.

**What is your late cancellation policy?**\
I require a minimum of 24 hours notice if you need to cancel a session. If you miss the 24-hour window, you will be responsible for the full fee for service. 

**When and why do packages expire?**\
At the moment, packages are optional. In this time of great change, the most important thing is making sure that sessions are available to all who need them.
