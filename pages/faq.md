# FAQs

Welcome to the practice. Here are a few helpful pieces of information to make your pre- and post- session experience smooth. If you do not find answers to your questions, feel free to reach out to me at info@jennifersokolov.com.

**What should I wear?**\
Please wear comfortable clothes that you could easily move in. Energy Therapy occurs lying on a massage table and I want you to be able to rest. Be prepared to remove big jewelry, watches and belts. You will also take off your shoes.

**What is the bathroom code?**\
The bathroom code is 0042—then take the handle up and then down. 

**What is your late cancellation policy?**\
I require a minimum of 24 hours notice if you need to cancel a session. If you miss the 24-hour window, you will be responsible for the full fee for service. 

**Should I come to a session sick?**\
As much as we all hate to lose time and money, coming to a session sick, especially if you are contagious, is not recommended. It creates stress on your system and can disrupt the atmosphere for the clients coming after you who may be immune compromised. 

**When and why do packages expire?**\
3 packs expire in 3 months. 10 packs expire in 6 months. The reason for this is that the alchemy of making a commitment to the work seems to have an important impact on the results. 

**What payment methods do you accept?**\
I accept credit cards, checks, Venmo, Zelle, and cash. 

**How soon should I book another session?**\
The frequency is very individual. If we are working to shift a complex situation, then weekly is the best rhythm. If there is stagnation and stuckness, monthly tends to be very helpful. Check-ins can happen at any time and can align with your life and goals, seasonal changes, or known stressors like the holiday season. 

**What happens if I need other support?**\
I have strong connections with a number of other wonderful practitioners of a variety of modalities. We can figure out together what you might need to compliment the healing work.
